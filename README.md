2. Password must have at least one Upper case alphabet.
3. Password must have at least one Lower case alphabet.

This code creates a button in a Google Colab notebook. When clicked, it generates a password according to your specified rules and displays it below the button. This is a good way to create simple interactive elements directly in your notebook without needing a traditional GUI library like Tkinter.
